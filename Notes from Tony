Good start. Couple of comments....[1] First, your Rmd document does not render on my machine b/c you've used a local copy of the dataset. For reproducibility, it would be better to refer to and load from the online dataset. [2] There's no need to `library()` dplyr or ggplot after loading tidyverse... tidyverse includes both of those. [3] This line (#18), `df <- data`, creates a problem that make the rest of your code not work. Maybe you meant `df <- d` (using data makes R think you are calling the data function). [4] Some of your plots, e.g., lines 53-59 and 73-78 are plotting Group Size versus DI (which is something different than I'd asked about), but the axis labels are odd. [5] RE: transforming variables, YES, some should be transformed. Try looking at the plots without versus with transformation :)
